    <p>African beads are not just accessories; they are rich expressions of heritage, artistry, and personal style. Whether you’re dressing up for a formal event or looking for a way to elevate your everyday look, there’s always a perfect way to incorporate beads into your outfit.</p>

    <h2>1. Everyday Elegance</h2>
    <p>For your daily wear, consider simple beaded earrings or bracelets. Earth tones like browns, greens, and muted oranges blend beautifully with casual outfits. Try pairing small beaded hoops with denim or flowy skirts to add a cultural touch without overpowering your look.</p>

    <h2>2. Formal & Event Looks</h2>
    <p>Weddings, galas, and ceremonies call for bold statements. Layered beaded necklaces in bright, contrasting colors can be the focal point of a plain dress. Coordinate colors with your outfit or go for a striking contrast for a high-fashion African-inspired aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>3. Office & Professional Wear</h2>
    <p>You can bring subtle elegance to work by incorporating minimal beaded accessories. A thin waistbead or neutral-toned necklace works well under structured outfits like blazers, giving a confident yet culturally expressive vibe.</p>

    <h2>4. Cultural Celebrations</h2>
    <p>During traditional festivals or cultural events, go all out! Beaded headpieces, arm cuffs, layered necklaces, and colorful earrings are perfect. These occasions are about pride and identity, so let your accessories celebrate your roots boldly.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Pairing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balance:</strong> If your outfit is patterned, go for solid-colored beads. If your clothes are plain, let the beads pop with bright colors.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix Materials:</strong> Don’t be afraid to pair beads with metals, cowrie shells, or leather for an eclectic look.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence is key:</strong> Own your look. African beads radiate authenticity and self-love—let your personality shine through.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Styling African beads is all about storytelling. Let your accessories speak for you, whether you're channeling royalty, spirituality, tradition, or everyday power. Nairobi’s bead culture is alive and evolving—find what feels like you and wear it proudly.</p>
